PySpark Practice Exercises
Welcome ! Here, I've been diving into PySpark to get a hang of some fundamental concepts. Let me walk you through what I've been up to:

StructType and StructField
So, you know how in PySpark, we work a lot with DataFrames, right? Well, to make sure our DataFrame has a proper structure, we use something called StructType and StructField. It's like giving our DataFrame a blueprint to follow! I've been playing around with these to define the structure of my data, like specifying column names and data types.

orderBy
Ever had a DataFrame that you wanted to sort? That's where orderBy comes in handy! It's like telling PySpark, "Hey, can you arrange this DataFrame for me, please?" I've been using orderBy to sort my DataFrames based on one or more columns, either in ascending or descending order.

groupBy
Now, imagine you have a bunch of data and you want to group it based on some common characteristics. That's exactly what groupBy does! It helps us group rows in our DataFrame based on certain columns. I've been experimenting with groupBy to organize my data and perform some cool aggregations.

udf
Sometimes, we want to do some custom operations on our DataFrame columns, right? That's where User Defined Functions (UDFs) come into play! With UDFs, we can apply our own custom logic to transform DataFrame columns. I've been using UDFs to do things like converting strings to uppercase or performing some complex calculations.
